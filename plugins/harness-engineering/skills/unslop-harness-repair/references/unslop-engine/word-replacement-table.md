# Word Replacement Table

Three-tier system. Tier determines when to flag.

**Tier 1:** Always replace. These appear 5-20x more often in AI text than human text.
**Tier 2:** Flag when 2+ appear in the same paragraph. Fine alone; suspicious in clusters.
**Tier 3:** Flag by density only. Normal words AI simply overuses. Flag when they make up ~3%+ of total words, or when they replace specific information that should be there.

Israel's Law applies throughout: if a simpler word conveys the same meaning, that is always the right choice.

## Template Phrases (Always Replace)

These slot-fill constructions signal generated prose. If a phrase has a blank where any word could go and still sound the same, it's too generic.

- "a [adjective] step toward [adjective] AI infrastructure" → describe the specific capability or outcome
- "a [adjective] step forward for [noun]" → say what actually changed
- "Whether you're [X] or [Y]" → false-breadth construction. Pick one audience or cut.
- "I recently had the pleasure of [verb]-ing" → just say what happened: "I talked to," "I read"
- "In today's [fast-paced / rapidly evolving] world" → cut entirely, or state the specific context
- "In an era where" → cut, or state the specific situation
- "Navigate the [landscape / ecosystem / space]" → name what they're doing in it

## Copula Avoidance Replacements (Always Fix)

AI text avoids "is" and "has" by substituting fancier verbs. Default back.

| AI version | Human version |
|---|---|
| serves as | is |
| stands as | is |
| boasts | has |
| features (as main verb) | has, includes |
| presents | is, shows |
| represents | is |
| functions as | is |
| offers (inflated) | has, gives |

Unless a more specific verb genuinely adds meaning, use "is" or "has."

## Vague Endorsement Phrases (Cut or Replace)

These substitute a generic thumbs-up for a specific reason. Say why something matters instead.

- worth reading
- worth paying attention to
- worth a look
- worth exploring
- worth checking out
- worth your time
- worth noting
